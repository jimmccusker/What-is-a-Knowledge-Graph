\section{Knowledge Graphs in Practice}
Rospocher, \textit{et al.} define knowledge graphs as collections of time-invariant facts about entities, typically derived from structured data sources such as Freebase \cite{Rospocher2016}. They cite a dearth of event representations in current knowledge graphs as a shortcoming - limiting knowledge graphs to encyclopedic items such as birth and death dates - primarily due to the difficulty of obtaining temporal data about entities in a structured manner. Recent surveys such as those by Hogenboom, \textit{et al.} \cite{Hogenboom2016} and Deng, \textit{et al.} \cite{Deng2015} provide overviews of numerous methods for event extraction from a variety of sources including social media, news, academic publications, and even images and video, indicating that there is a great interest in finding ways to interpret and include such temporal data in a more structured format.


Freebase is a knowledge graph that is open to public access and curation \cite{Bollacker_2008}, and has become the basis for the Google Knowledge Graph, which has extended it with knowledge gleaned from their regular search engine crawls of the web \cite{singhal2012introducing}.

Zhang \cite{zhang2002knowledge} presents a formal theory of knowledge graphs as a specialization of semantic networks where meaning is expressed as structure, statements are unambiguous, and a limited set of relation types are used.
These requirements also minimize redundancy within the knowledge graph, which simplifies analytical operations (including reasoning and queries).


\subsection{Knowledge Graph Methods}
Corby and Zucker present an abstract knowledge graph querying machine they call KGRAM \cite{Corby_2010}, but do not define knowledge graphs beyond being labeled directed graphs.
This seems to be an abstraction of graph query methods and discusses how KGRAM is a generalization and extension of the RDF graph query language SPARQL \cite{harris2013sparql}.
Wang \emph{et al.} \cite{Wang_knowledgegraph} discuss projecting generalized knowledge graphs into hyperplanes, but also only focuses on the labeled directed graph requirement of knowledge graphs.
Pujara \emph{et al.} use probabilistic soft logic (PSL) to manage uncertainty in knowledge graphs that have been extracted from uncertain sources \cite{Pujara_2013}. 
They argue that many current knowledge graphs do not always clearly identify entities, relying instead on labels that can be different due to spelling variations.
Their task of ``knowledge graph identification'' has a goal of identifying a set of true assertions from noisy extractions.
They do not claim to manage the provenance of the resulting knowledge graph assertions, however.
Lin \emph{et al.} attempt link prediction for automated knowledge graph construction but only rely on a directed labeled graph model of knowledge graphs \cite{lin2015learning}.
Hakkani-Tur \emph{et al.} use statistical language understanding to pose structured questions against the Freebase knowledge graph, focusing on improving the extraction of relation detection in the queries \cite{Hakkani_Tur_2013}.
